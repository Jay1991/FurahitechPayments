```java
 PaymentRequest request=new PaymentRequest();
 
 /*For card merchant credentials */
 request.setCardMerchantKey("");
 request.setCardMerchantSecret("");
 
 /*Customer details*/
 request.setCustomerEmailAddress("");
 request.setCustomerFirstName("");

 /*Transaction other details*/
 request.setTransactionAmount(0);
 request.setTransactionFee(0);
 request.setPaymentDesc("Paying amount X for X reason");
 
 /*HTTP request endPoints*/
 request.setPaymentRequestEndPoint("");
 
 /*Build request*/
  FurahitechPay.getInstance()
                  .with(this)
                  .setPaymentRequest(request)
                  .setPaymentMode(MODE_CARD)
                  .setPaymentEnvironment(LIVE).build();

 request.setPaymentRequestEndPoint("");
 
 /*Build request*/
 FurahitechPay.getInstance()
                 .with(this)
                 .setPaymentRequest(request)
                 .setPaymentEnvironment(SANDBOX)
                 .setPaymentMode(MODE_MOBILE)
                 .setSupportedGateway(GATEWAY_TIGOPESA)
                 .setPaymentEnvironment(LIVE).request();
 
```


Initialize payment request (M-Pesa):
```java
 PaymentRequest request=new PaymentRequest();
 
 /*Merchant credentials - M-Pes*/
  request.setWazoHubClientID("");
  request.setWazoHubClientSecret("");
 
 /*Customer details*/
 request.setCustomerEmailAddress("");
 request.setCustomerFirstName("");
 request.setCustomerLastName("");
 
 /*Transaction other details*/
 request.setTransactionAmount(0);
 request.setTransactionFee(0);
 request.setPaymentDesc("Paying amount X for X reason");
 
 /*HTTP request endPoints*/
 request.setPaymentRequestEndPoint("");
 request.setPaymentLogsEndPoint("");
 
 /*Build request*/
 FurahitechPay.getInstance()
                 .with(this)
                 .setPaymentRequest(request)
                 .setPaymentEnvironment(SANDBOX)
                 .setPaymentMode(MODE_MOBILE)
                 .setSupportedGateway(GATEWAY_MPESA)
                 .setPaymentEnvironment(LIVE).request();
 
```

Payment request and log end-point configuration, write your site URL with added "/".It should be the exact location on your server where PaymentGatewayAPIs-PHP files were uploaded.
```html
 exampledomain.com/
```
Passing extra data to the Library for payment process, it might might be product Id or anything
```java
...
 /*Passing extra param*/
 HashMap<String,String> extras=new HashMap<>();
 extras.put("id_key","id_value");
 request.setPaymentExtraParam(extras);
```

In case you don't fully support all mobile payments just pass supported ones.
```java
...
//Remove unsupported ones from parameter list
.setSupportedGateway(GATEWAY_MPESA,GATEWAY_TIGOPESA)
```

For SANDBOX development environment
```java
...
//use SANDBOX as parameter by default it is LIVE
.setPaymentEnvironment(SANDBOX)
```

Get payment status
```java
    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        if(resultCode==RESULT_OK){
            switch (requestCode){
                case REQUEST_CODE_PAYMENT_STATUS:
                    PaymentStatus status= (PaymentStatus) data.getSerializableExtra(RESULT_PAYMENT_STATUS);
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
```

Sometimes you might want to add this to your AndroidManifest.xml to make API use your app's default theme:
```xml
<application
   tools:replace="tools:theme"
    ...
    >
```
